# whoIsHome

Who is home - polls my D-Link router for the DHCP Table, parses the resulting XML, and enters it into a Django-Powered web interface

This project was built to run on a Raspberry PI 2, and with a very specific router and network configuration.  Your mileage will vary.  

# Hardware Requirements
* D-Link DIR-813 (or compatible)
  * Hardware Version: B1
  * Firmware Version: 2.08
* Python3 capable system with network access
* Probably Linux
